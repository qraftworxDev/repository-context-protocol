## Current Work Focus
**Python Parser Enhancement: Multiple Return Type Support**

Recently completed work fixing a critical limitation in the Python parser's method signature generation where only the first return type was being used.

## Recent Changes

### Problem Identified
The ```455:473:internal/ast/python/parser.go``` `buildMethodSignature` function was only using `method.Returns[0].Name` for method signatures, ignoring any additional return types that Python functions might have.

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the `buildMethodSignature` function to:

1. **Handle Single Return Types**: Preserves existing behavior for single return types
2. **Handle Multiple Different Types**: Formats as `Union[type1, type2, type3]` for different return types
3. **Handle Multiple Identical Types**: Optimizes identical return types to single type representation
4. **Handle No Return Types**: Maintains default `None` behavior

### Key Implementation Details
- Added `allReturnTypesSame()` helper function to detect duplicate return types
- Used `Union[...]` syntax for multiple different return types (Python standard)
- Comprehensive test coverage with `TestPythonParser_MultipleReturnTypes`

## Current Status
- ✅ Multiple return type support implemented and tested
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ New test cases cover edge cases (single, multiple, identical, none)

## Next Steps
Consider enhancing the Python extractor (`extractor.py`) to better parse complex return type annotations like:
- `Union[str, int]` → separate into multiple PythonTypeInfo entries
- `Tuple[str, int, bool]` → handle tuple unpacking scenarios
- `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` → parse nested type structures

## Technical Notes
The fix maintains backward compatibility while extending functionality. The implementation follows Python typing conventions and integrates cleanly with the existing parser architecture.
