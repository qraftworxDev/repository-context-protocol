## Current Work Focus
**MCP Server Development: Foundation Phase Complete**

Successfully implemented the foundational structure for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration, providing AI agents with access to repository analysis capabilities.

## Recent Changes

### MCP Server Foundation Implementation
Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the MCP server development:

#### Infrastructure Created
1. **Dependencies**: Added `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/mcp` library
2. **Package Structure**: Created `cmd/mcp/` and `internal/mcp/` directories
3. **Main Binary**: Implemented `cmd/mcp/main.go` for the MCP server
4. **Core Server**: Built `internal/mcp/server.go` with key functionality

#### Key Components Implemented
- **`RepoContextMCPServer` struct**: Main server implementation
- **Repository Detection**: `detectRepositoryRoot()` method
- **Query Engine Integration**: `initializeQueryEngine()` method
- **Validation System**: `validateRepository()` method
- **Response Formatting**: Success and error response helpers
- **Basic Tool Handlers**: Skeleton implementations for core tools

#### Testing & Build Integration
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: TDD approach with full test coverage
- **Makefile Integration**: Updated build system to include MCP binary
- **Binary Generation**: Successfully building `repocontext-mcp` executable

## Current Status
- ✅ MCP server foundation implemented and tested (Phase 1: 60% complete)
- ✅ All unit tests passing with comprehensive TDD coverage
- ✅ Build system integrated with MCP binary generation
- ✅ Repository detection and validation systems operational

## Next Steps
**Phase 1 Completion**: Implement remaining core tools:
- `query_by_name` - Full functionality with query engine integration
- `query_by_pattern` - Pattern-based search implementation
- `list_functions` - Repository function enumeration
- `list_types` - Repository type enumeration
- `get_call_graph` - Call relationship analysis

**Phase 2 Preparation**: Begin advanced query tools development

## Technical Notes
The MCP implementation follows the established patterns in the codebase and integrates seamlessly with the existing query engine. The foundation provides a solid base for extending AI agent capabilities to analyze and understand code repositories through standardized MCP protocol.
